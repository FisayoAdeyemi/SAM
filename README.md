# System Advisor Model (SAM)

This is the gh-pages branch for NREL's System Advisor Model (SAM). The main SAM code respository is at https://github.com/NREL/SAM/tree/develop.

The following URL points to the release notes: https://nrel.github.io/SAM/doc/releasenotes.html.

For now gh-pages stores the release notes that are displayed on the SAM website at https://sam.nrel.gov/download and from the SAM application's Help window.

Eventually, we will deploy SAM's Help system from this repository.
